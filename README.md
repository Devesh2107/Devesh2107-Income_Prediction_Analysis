# Income Prediction Analysis

This project involves analyzing the "Adult" dataset to predict whether an individual's income exceeds $50K based on various socio-economic factors.

## Dataset

The dataset includes features such as age, workclass, education, marital status, occupation, race, sex, and more. The target variable is the income class (`<=50K` or `>50K`).

## Project Steps

1. **Data Wrangling**: 
   - Handled missing values.
   - Encoded categorical variables.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualized relationships between features and the target variable.
   - Identified key patterns and correlations.

3. **Model Building**:
   - Implemented classification models like XGBoost to predict income class.
   - Evaluated model performance using accuracy and other metrics.

## Results

The models showed [briefly describe your model's performance or any interesting insights].

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required libraries (`pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, etc.).
3. Open the `project.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
4. Run the cells to see the analysis.

## Conclusion

This project provided valuable insights into income prediction based on socio-economic factors. The models built can be further optimized for better performance.
